|PSMDB| is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that is
a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 3.6 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 3.6 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends Community Edition functionality by including the
:ref:`inmemory` storage engine, as well as several enterprise-grade features.
Also it includes :ref:`mongorocks` storage engine, which is now deprecated.
|PSMDB| requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.6.6 
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6/#jul-10-2018>`_
and provides the following additional changes:

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-232`: |PSMDB| was crashing if got out of memory in case when
  replicaset was initiated with :ref:`inmemory` storage engine.
